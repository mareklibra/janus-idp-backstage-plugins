# Notifications Common

The @backstage/plugin-notifications-common library holds types, constants and functionality shared between notifications-backend and notifications-frontend plugins.

It can be imported in a consuming 3rd-party BE or FE plugin to ease the process of creating or receiving notifications by sharing the same TypeScript types.
